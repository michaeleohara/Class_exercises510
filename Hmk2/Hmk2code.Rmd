```{r}
rm(list = ls())
library(tidyverse)
  ###   tidyverse will load in all the packages we will need to tidy 
  ###   and plot our data

```



```{r}
###   The data used here are from Hart, O'Hara, and Sirianni 2017
###   "The Effect of Sustainability Commit- ments on College Admissions: 
###     Evidence from the Presidentsâ€™ Climate Commitment"
###   Which is currently being drooled over at JEEM 
qual.dat <- read.csv("quality.csv")
head(qual.dat)
                      
```


```{r}
###  This code does the manipulation for steps 1-3 on homework
###  Then produces the graph for number 4

vars <- c("unitid", "year", "satscale75", "public", signACUPCC = "treat", signatory = "tgroup", "rsalt", "rinc", "rtufe", "diplomas")
sat_sum <- qual.dat %>%
      select(one_of(vars)) %>%
      rename(signACUPCC = treat, signatory = tgroup, 
                   AvgProfSalary = rsalt,
                   MedStateInc = rinc,
                   Cost = rtufe) %>%
      filter(!is.na(AvgProfSalary)) %>%
      mutate(public = ifelse(public == 1, "public", "private")) %>%
      group_by(year, public) %>%
      summarise(avg.sat = mean(satscale75))

ggplot(sat_sum, aes(x = year, y = avg.sat)) + 
   geom_point(mapping = aes(x = year, y = avg.sat, color = public)) + 
   geom_line(data = filter(sat_sum, public == "public"), color = "light blue") +
   geom_line(data = filter(sat_sum, public == "private"), color = "orange") +
  labs(title = "Average applications", y = "Applications")
```


```{r}
###  This code produces the graph for number 5
###  By grouping the data by 'signatory' rather than 'public'

sat_sum2 <- qual.dat %>%
      select(one_of(vars)) %>%
      rename(signACUPCC = treat, signatory = tgroup, 
                   AvgProfSalary = rsalt,
                   MedStateInc = rinc,
                   Cost = rtufe) %>%
      filter(!is.na(AvgProfSalary)) %>%
      mutate(signatory = ifelse(signatory == 1, "signatory", "nonsignatory")) %>%
      group_by(year, signatory) %>%
      summarise(avg.sat = mean(satscale75))

ggplot(sat_sum2, aes(x = year, y = avg.sat)) + 
   geom_point(mapping = aes(x = year, y = avg.sat, color = signatory)) + 
   geom_line(data = filter(sat_sum2, signatory == "signatory"), color = "light blue") +
   geom_line(data = filter(sat_sum2, signatory == "nonsignatory"), color = "orange") 
```


Now, can we get the graphs faceted by public and private schools?? 

```{r}
###   Question 6:
###   Now the challenge. Can we facet the graph? 
###   To do so requires that we have both the variables 
###   public and signatory in the dataset.
###   So, we need to group the data by both. 
sat_sum3 <- qual.dat %>%
      select(one_of(vars)) %>%
      rename(signACUPCC = treat, signatory = tgroup, 
                   AvgProfSalary = rsalt,
                   MedStateInc = rinc,
                   Cost = rtufe) %>%
      filter(!is.na(AvgProfSalary)) %>%
      mutate(public = ifelse(public == 1, "public", "private")) %>%
      mutate(signatory = ifelse(signatory == 1, "signatory", "nonsignatory")) %>%
      group_by(year, signatory, public) %>%  ## note the difference here
      summarise(avg.sat = mean(satscale75))

##  Tweak the classes on both variables
  #sat_sum3$signatory <- as.factor(sat_sum3$signatory)
  #sat_sum3$public <- as.factor(sat_sum3$public)

###  Then plot 
ggplot(sat_sum3, aes(x = year, y = avg.sat)) + 
   geom_point(mapping = aes(x = year, y = avg.sat, color = signatory)) + 
   geom_line(data = filter(sat_sum3, signatory == "signatory"), color = "light blue") +
   geom_line(data = filter(sat_sum3, signatory == "nonsignatory"), color = "orange")  +
  facet_wrap(~ public) + ggtitle("SAT Scores Private vs Public") + labs(x="Year", y="SAT Scores")
```

Almost like I knew what I was doing...
