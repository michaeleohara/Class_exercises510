R Markdown files used in Econ 510 at Hamilton College

This project contains the R Markdown exercises I used in my class for a senior seminar called Topics in Environmental economics. The *class_exercises* folder contains exercises we did in class, to demonstrate different tools for data analysis. Then I assigned homeworks where students had to modify them a bit, maybe using different data.

The next time I do such a class, I will assign more homeworks. I found that the exercises I did in class but did not assign left little impression. Students would come to me to ask how to do things, when we had already done it in class and the code was posted for them.
